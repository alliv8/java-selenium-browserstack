# Java-selenium-browserstack
 ---
 Run tests using Java on BrowserStack's Selenium grid of 3000+ real devices and desktop browsers. This sample project is based on the TestNG runner and BrowserStack SDK. Checkout integration with other Java frameworks [here](#) <link to bottom section>.
 
If you prefer to perform the integration steps manually, switch to [manual-integration](#w3c). This is useful only if you have a customized testing framework or have advanced use-cases.
